# Omni-Team-Framework-DEAD-
Omni-Team Framwork was a PHP Based SMS/Email Alert System I was making for Team Exile. Since Team Exile ended the project was no longer necessary and I ended it.

All of this project was written by me. I used Bootstrap for the simple fact it is quicker than designing my own look. It was a backend after all.
The Site function was to show a schedule on the Main page and allow Coaches to manage their players and the system to automatically send an SMS and Email to the Number and Email Provided.
